# Healthcare-data-Aggregation
Data integration and aggregation solution for the healthcare sector.
This is to share with you what I have learnt so far and also share a data integration and aggregation solution for the healthcare sector.

According to a 2023 study on Challenges of data paucity in Africa where it was reported that it was due to a number of factors but I would be focusing on this statment from the study findings '...the available data, despite its limitations, is often underutilized due to a lack of capacity...'

imagine being able to integrate more than one healthcare data source and aggregates information to generate actionable insights for the healthcare stakeholders.
Insights and Recommendations
1. Targeted Interventions for Marburg Virus:
   Marburg Virus is associated with high mortality rates. To address this, targeted interventions should focus on:
   - Strengthening public health surveillance systems to detect outbreaks early.
   - Implementing strict infection control measures in healthcare settings.
   - Conducting public awareness campaigns to educate communities about the symptoms, transmission, and prevention of 
Marburg Virus.

2. Preventive Measures for Age Group 30-49:
   Age group 30-49 has the highest patient count. To promote preventive healthcare and well-being among this age group, 
the following measures can be recommended:
   - Encouraging regular health check-ups and screenings for early detection of diseases.
   - Promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors, such as regular exercise, balanced diet, and stress management.
   - Providing access to educational resources and support for managing chronic conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension.

3. Resource Allocation Based on Disease Burden:
   Allocate healthcare resources based on the disease burden and healthcare costs associated with each disease. 
Prioritize funding and support for:
   - Diseases with high mortality rates and severe health outcomes.
   - Regions and communities with a higher prevalence of diseases and greater healthcare needs.

4. Focus on Nassarawa for Healthcare Provision and on Lagos healthacare system to replicate to other states:
   Nassarawa has the highest patient count. Therefore, healthcare provision and resource allocation should be 
prioritized for this region. This may include:
   - Strengthening healthcare infrastructure and facilities.
   - Enhancing access to quality healthcare services, including medical facilities and personnel.

5. Healthcare Disparities Between Urban and Rural Settlements:
   Urban settlements have a higher death rate than rural areas. To address this disparity, efforts should focus on:
   - Improving access to healthcare services in urban areas, including primary care facilities and emergency services.
   - Addressing social determinants of health, such as poverty, housing conditions, and access to clean water and sanitation.

6. Regional Disparities in Disease Burden:
   Northeast region has the lowest disease count, while the South East has the highest. Strategies should be tailored 
to address regional disparities in disease burden:
   - Conduct further research to understand the underlying factors contributing to regional differences in disease prevalence.
   - Implement targeted interventions and health promotion programs to address specific health needs in each region.

Conclusion:
The analysis of the dataset `ra_merged` highlights significant patterns and trends in disease distribution, 
healthcare outcomes, and resource utilization. By leveraging these insights and recommendations, 
healthcare policymakers and stakeholders can develop targeted interventions, allocate resources effectively, 
and implement strategies to improve healthcare delivery, ultimately enhancing the overall health and well-being 
of the population.
